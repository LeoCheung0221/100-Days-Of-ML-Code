# Day 59 · Zero-return baseline

[Phase I · Models](../../README.en.md) · runs

What you learn today: baseline MSE 0.000101; line 0.000081

## Plain-language account

Predict zero every day: baseline test MSE 0.000101. The line at 0.000081 beats doing nothing on squared error.

The 0.000020 gap is named on day 60; keep both scores on the page.

Zero baseline is a level forecast, not a direction oracle.

Data come from name AAA in days/data/panel.csv: simple returns from adjusted close ratios minus one. Usable rows start after the fifth return, so five fewer rows than the raw panel. The default split is the first seventy-five percent of those rows in time order for train and the rest for test (often fifty-four train, nineteen test). Same-bar high, low, and close must not explain same-day return; same-day market return is not a valid feature or label unless the day script says otherwise.

Day 59 zero baseline MSE 0.000101 loses to line 0.000081—baseline is a naive control, not the deliverable model.

Treat English stdout keys as the diff authority—spaces around equals, signs, six decimals, and FORBIDDEN lines stay verbatim.

Line test MSE 0.000081 stays the frozen day-51 benchmark on nineteen hold-out rows unless this day explicitly changes the split or label.

## Core

```text
baseline predict return = 0 every day
baseline test MSE = 0.000101
line test MSE = 0.000081
```

Test MSE on returns is not the price-level SSE from days 45–46. Hold-out rows are the only score set; coefficients and thresholds are fit on train only.

| Idea | Changes this day? | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Five-lag line coeffs | Usually frozen | From day 51 train |
| test MSE 0.000081 | Reprinted on MSE days | Diagnostics use MAE/direction/bill |
| forbidden OHLC/market | Contract holds | See days 56–57, 67 |
| train/test rows | Default 54/19 | Day 58 calendar cut excepted |

Day 59 prints 3 contract lines:

- `baseline predict return = 0 every day`: match the terminal verbatim—keys, spacing, signs, six decimals.
- `baseline test MSE = 0.000101`: match the terminal verbatim—keys, spacing, signs, six decimals.
- `line test MSE = 0.000081`: match the terminal verbatim—keys, spacing, signs, six decimals.

Lag-5 anchors: line test MSE 0.000081, volume helped false (day 54), total bill line −18.0000 (days 75 and 79). Do not paste anchors on days that do not print them; do not round or drop signs when they appear. Day 58’s 0.000782 belongs to the calendar split, not the 0.000081 ruler. BBB 0.000105 stays beside AAA—no auto-transfer.

## Further out

Report baseline and line together.

Day 60 prints improvement and the smallest-error day index.

Zero baseline 0.000101 versus line 0.000081. Day 60 names improvement 0.000020 and index 13 absolute error.

Engineer reading order: run today's script first, then read the page; do not skip day 51 before diagnostics or the frozen coefficients lose context. Unit tests should assert hold-out scores against printed literals; common failures mix train rows or tickers. Screenshots should show English keys and six-decimal scores. Use python3; tiny float noise is fine, but contract integers like quiet=10, jump=5, and direction wrong=3 must not drift.

Reproduce by running today's script first; unit tests should assert hold-out literals; do not mix train rows or paste price SSE as return MSE.

Hand in one paragraph stating which part of the contract changes today, citing at least one printed anchor.

Days 56–57 print task and FORBIDDEN lines; default features remain five lagged returns unless the script says otherwise. Day 67’s market-leak run is not a valid result row.

Time-ordered split matches day 7 hold-out logic. Day 58’s 0.000782 belongs to a calendar cut experiment—it does not replace 0.000081.

Paper the train mask before hand-checking rows. Common failures: BBB rows in AAA, or price SSE pasted as return MSE.

Screenshots should show English keys and six-decimal literals; Chinese prose may be long but the terminal is the diff authority.

Frozen-coefficient days score test rows with ŷ=Xβ̂ only—no test refit. Later direction and bill days change the metric, not the day-51 line anchor.

Day 9 row-order invariance needs intact pairs in X; shuffling before lag construction breaks alignment.

Return labels come from adjusted close; do not paste day 1–10 price slopes or RSS into lag-5 return notes.

Slides should pair English stdout keys with Chinese prose—Chinese-only numbers fail literal diff grading.

Day 40 leakage checks column semantics; days 56–57 reject same-bar OHLC—the lists stack, not replace.

Quiet ten, jump five, direction-wrong three are contract integers from day 71—do not round them into percentages.

Compare tree and line on hold-out MSE; lower train MSE alone is not a generalization argument.

## What the run showed

```bash
python3 days/59-zero-baseline/zero_baseline.py
```

The script should print stdout matching the core block. Implementation: [`zero_baseline.py`](../../days/59-zero-baseline/zero_baseline.py).

Checklist: train/test counts match the script; English keys, signs, and six-decimal literals match the terminal; FORBIDDEN and not-a-result lines stay verbatim; do not swap line versus tree MSE or bill columns; lag-5 anchors (MSE 0.000081, volume helped false, bill −18) stay untouched unless you re-run and update the whole contract.
